 *
 * HIDE FOR DESKTOP:
 @include breakpoint-down(small) {
    background: red;
 }
 * HIDE FOR MOBILE:
 @include breakpoint-up(medium) {
    background: blue;
 }
 *
 * if you are designing your layout with a mobile-first approach, then use min-width breakpoints and work your way up.
 * if you are designing for larger devices first, then set your default CSS as you normally would and adjust for smaller devices with the max-width approach.
